	//Arrays - advanced level programming
	//Data Structures and Algorihms		
	//Array is the collection of homogeneous (similar) data types
	//[] - This is a dimention of an array.
	//[][] - 2 Dimentions
	//Arrays are divided into 2 types. 1 Dimentional & Multi D. 
	//Arrays index position starts from 0
	//Arrays take up space in HEAP Memory.
	//Created at run time. 
	//Elements of arrays can be stored at consecutive memory locations.
	//Advantages: 1. Can store multiple values. 2. Faster data types than primitive. 3. Can store Objects 
	//Disadvantages: 1. Fixed size, can't increase/decrease the size at run time. 2. Memory wastage.
	//3. Can only store data of 1 type.
